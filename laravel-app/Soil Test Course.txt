📘 Chapter 1: Foundations of Soil Therapy – The Power of the Test
________________


🎬 Chapter Introduction – Unlocking the Hidden Language of Your Soil
Welcome to Chapter 1: Foundations of Soil Therapy, where we begin our journey into understanding the true power of soil testing. This chapter lays the groundwork for everything that follows, and if there’s one key message, it’s this:
🌱 You can’t manage what you don’t measure.
 And when it comes to soil, your test results are the most powerful decision-making tool you have.
In this session, Graeme Sait introduces you to a new way of thinking—a root cause approach. For decades, conventional agriculture has leaned heavily on input-based systems that treat symptoms rather than addressing the real problems. The result? Rising costs, increasing chemical dependency, and diminishing returns.
But there’s a better way. Nutrition Farming® empowers growers to understand their soil, take back control, and make informed choices that are good for the crop, the planet, and the bottom line. And it all starts with a good soil test.
Graeme explains not just how to read a soil test, but why it's the cornerstone of farm resilience and profitability. You’ll learn about key testing concepts like CEC, pH, base saturation, and mineral ratios—as well as how imbalances can trigger a cascade of issues that compromise plant health, reduce yields, and increase pest and disease pressure.
You’ll also be introduced to two essential visual tools:
* Mulder’s Chart, which illustrates how minerals interact (positively or antagonistically)

* A cation antagonism pie chart, showing how excesses in one mineral can restrict others

What makes this session particularly valuable is Graeme’s ability to connect science to story, and numbers to outcomes. He’ll show you how even small missteps—like applying the wrong kind of lime or blindly trusting fertiliser advice—can set you back. And more importantly, he’ll teach you how to avoid them.
By the end of this chapter, you’ll begin to see soil testing not as a confusing lab report, but as a powerful, practical tool—one that gives you the clarity and confidence to farm smarter.

📝 Detailed Summary
🌱 Soil Testing as the Gateway to Root Cause Farming
Graeme opens with the principle that underpins all of Nutrition Farming®: solving problems at the source. Instead of using synthetic chemicals to suppress symptoms like pests or diseases, he argues we must identify and address the mineral or biological causes behind them.
He cites concerning data showing chemical use has increased globally every year for decades, while pest and disease pressure has also risen—clear evidence that the current model is broken.
________________


🔄 The Interplay: Minerals, Microbes, and Humus
At the core of Graeme’s framework are three interconnected elements:
   1. Minerals – the building blocks of soil fertility

   2. Microbes – the life forms that cycle those minerals

   3. Humus – the organic carbon sponge that retains nutrients and moisture

While all three are essential, this series focuses heavily on minerals and how to interpret their presence, absence, and balance using a soil test.
________________


🧪 What Makes a Good Soil Test?
A useful soil test should include:
      * Base Saturation Percentages – showing how calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium are held on the soil colloid

      * Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) – indicating the soil’s storage capacity for nutrients

      * Key Ratios like calcium to magnesium

      * Total Exchange Capacity (TEC) – especially important for acidic soils

Labs like AEL in Australia (used by NTS) are referenced, but any test that offers comprehensive data and includes TEC is acceptable.
________________


📉 Common Mistakes to Avoid
         * Overapplying calcium: Can shut down seven other minerals, including phosphate and boron.

         * Using dolomite in high-magnesium soils: Increases compaction and restricts oxygen.

         * Applying potassium when levels are already high: Can reduce calcium uptake and cell strength, increasing disease pressure.

         * Trusting fertiliser advice blindly: If you don’t understand your soil test, you risk being misled by input suppliers.

________________


📊 Visual Tools: Mulder’s Chart & Cation Pie
Graeme introduces:
            * Mulder’s Chart – a web of arrows showing which minerals stimulate or antagonise others

               * Example: Calcium stimulates phosphate, zinc, boron, etc.—but excess calcium antagonises them all

                  * Cation Antagonism Pie Chart – shows how cations in excess (e.g. potassium, magnesium, sodium) can suppress others

👉 Tip: Print and laminate these charts to keep them in your office or grower shed as ongoing references.
________________


⚖️ Balance Over Quantity
It’s not about how much of a mineral you have—it’s how well they work together:
                     * Calcium is essential, but more isn’t always better.

                     * Phosphate might be present, but if pH or other minerals are off, it may not be available.

                     * pH is a master variable—it controls the availability of all nutrients.

________________


🌡️ The Role of pH in Nutrient Uptake
Graeme explains the pH-nutrient availability chart:
                        * Ideal soil pH = 6.4

                        * Low pH (5.0) limits nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, etc.

                        * High pH (8.5+) locks out iron, zinc, manganese, boron

✅ Foliar feeding can bypass high or low pH and deliver trace minerals directly to the leaf—up to 12 times more efficiently than soil application.
________________


⚡ Cations vs Anions: The Chemistry of Soil
                           * Cations: Positively charged (Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, K⁺, Na⁺)

                           * Anions: Negatively charged (NO₃⁻, PO₄³⁻, SO₄²⁻)

This distinction helps explain:
                              * Why anions like nitrate leach more easily

                              * Why cations are held on the soil colloid

                              * Why humus (which holds anions) is such a valuable storage bank

________________


📌 Key Takeaways
                                 * Soil testing is the most empowering tool in your agronomic toolbox.

                                 * Understanding mineral ratios and interactions is more important than chasing raw numbers.

                                 * pH and base saturation are crucial concepts for managing nutrient availability.

                                 * Use Mulder’s Chart and Cation Pie Charts to visualise interactions.

                                 * Foliar nutrition is a strategic way to correct imbalances quickly and cost-effectively.

⏭️ Up Next: Chapter 2 – Cracking the Code of Your Soil Test
In the next chapter, we move from theory into application. You’ll learn exactly what each line item on your soil test means, how to interpret values like CEC, TEC, conductivity, and pH—and what those numbers actually tell you about your soil's health and productivity potential.






📘 Chapter 2: Cracking the Code – How to Read and Interpret Your Soil Test
________________


🎬 Chapter Introduction – Turning Numbers into Knowledge
Now that you understand the philosophy and purpose behind soil testing, it’s time to roll up your sleeves and start interpreting the numbers.
In Chapter 2, Graeme Sait takes us deeper into the soil test itself—line by line—and demystifies the key terms that appear on most commercial soil reports. If Chapter 1 was about why we test soil, this chapter is all about how to use those results to guide better decisions on the farm.
You’ll learn to identify the critical parameters like:
                                    * Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) – the “bucket size” of your soil

                                    * Total Exchange Capacity (TEC) – reveals the presence of acidity-driving hydrogen

                                    * Organic Matter – the single greatest predictor of soil productivity

                                    * pH – the gateway to mineral uptake

                                    * Conductivity – your mineral “oomph” level

This chapter is rich in practical insights, including how to measure your own pH and conductivity at home, how to understand hydrogen’s impact on nutrient availability, and why paramagnetism might be a hidden fertility factor in volcanic soils.
By the end, you’ll not only understand the terms on your test—you’ll begin to recognize how they influence one another and what actions they suggest.

📝 Detailed Summary
🧮 1. Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) – The Soil's Storage Tank
                                       * CEC measures the soil’s ability to store nutrients—specifically cations like calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium.

                                       * Heavy clay soils = high CEC (e.g., 40+)

                                       * Light sandy soils = low CEC (e.g., 3–5)

💡 Tip: In low-CEC soils, don’t broadcast large inputs—it’s better to spoon-feed through fertigation or foliar application.
________________


⚡ 2. Cation Exchange Process – The Hydrogen Effect
When a plant absorbs a cation (like calcium), it must release another cation to maintain electrical balance. It doesn’t give up potassium or magnesium—instead, it exchanges hydrogen.
                                          * Hydrogen is not a nutrient—it’s an acidifier.

                                          * More hydrogen = lower pH = fewer beneficial cations left on the colloid.

🌡️ Key Insight: High hydrogen content means your soil is acidic and depleted of base cations. This is why you must measure hydrogen on your test (via TEC).
________________


🧪 3. TEC vs CEC – The Hidden Acid in the System
                                             * TEC (Total Exchange Capacity) = CEC + hydrogen

                                             * If your test doesn’t include TEC, you’re flying blind in acidic soils.

📉 Example: You might think you have “perfect balance” with 68% calcium, 12% magnesium… but you actually have 30% hydrogen and a pH of 5.5. That 68% calcium is really only ~48% in a full picture.
📌 Always choose a test that measures both CEC and TEC.
________________


🧲 4. Paramagnetism – Energy in the Earth
Paramagnetism refers to a soil’s ability to attract and convert atmospheric energy (long-wave radio frequencies) into light energy (biophotons).
                                                * Volcanic soils are naturally high in paramagnetism.

                                                * You can boost fertility by adding basalt crusher dust, which is inexpensive and high in paramagnetic charge.

🧠 Graeme references the work of Professor Phil Callahan, who discovered that these “antenna-like” soils improve biological activity and crop performance.

🌡️ 5. pH – The Mineral Gatekeeper
                                                   * Ideal pH: 6.4 (same target for plant sap pH and even human/cow urine)

                                                   * Nutrient availability peaks at this level

                                                   * Acidic soils (pH < 5.5): Poor phosphorus, calcium, nitrogen availability

                                                   * Alkaline soils (pH > 8): Iron, manganese, zinc, boron are locked out

✅ Use DIY pH testing:
                                                      1. Mix equal parts soil and deionized water

                                                      2. Shake and wait 5 minutes

                                                      3. Test with a pH strip or probe

                                                      4. Do this in multiple paddock zones—pH often varies across a field

🧬 6. Organic Matter – The #1 Fertility Indicator
                                                         * Ideal range: 4–7%

                                                         * Australian average: ~1.7%

Organic matter:
                                                            * Buffers nutrients

                                                            * Stores water

                                                            * Improves structure

                                                            * Holds negatively charged minerals (anions) like nitrate, phosphate, sulfate

📊 Case Study: A National Bank study of 700 Australian farms found that organic matter was the single strongest predictor of farm profitability. Even a 0.15% increase raised land value substantially.
🎯 Key Insight: Improving humus = improving profits. And soon, growers may get paid for doing so through carbon credits.

⚡ 7. Conductivity – Do You Have Enough "Oomph"?
                                                               * Measured with a conductivity (EC) meter and deionized water

                                                               * Starting point: 0.2 EC for most crops

                                                               * Flowering/fruiting stage: 0.6–0.8 EC

                                                               * Avoid >1.0–1.2 EC (can lead to salt stress)

Potassium is the biggest driver of conductivity. If EC is low, potassium is the first place to look.
📌 Graeme recommends checking EC and potassium together to diagnose plant “stagnation.”

📌 Key Takeaways
                                                                  * CEC tells you how much your soil can hold—use it to guide your input strategy.

                                                                  * Always test for hydrogen (TEC), or you risk misinterpreting base saturation.

                                                                  * Organic matter is the #1 predictor of productivity—track it and build it.

                                                                  * pH affects everything—know your paddock zones and adjust accordingly.

                                                                  * Use conductivity to monitor nutrient sufficiency and vigor.

                                                                  * Don’t overlook the energetic side of soil—paramagnetism may be the hidden force in high-performing volcanic soils.

________________


⏭️ Coming Up: Chapter 3 – Working with Real Tests and Real Numbers
In Chapter 3, we’ll go even deeper by analyzing actual soil test data. You’ll see how to:
                                                                     * Interpret mineral levels (ppm and base saturation)

                                                                     * Diagnose imbalances

                                                                     * Plan corrective strategies (e.g., foliar sprays, root zone management)

                                                                     * Work with macro and trace elements

This is where knowledge meets application—don’t miss it.




📘 Chapter 3: From Data to Decisions – Interpreting Real Soil Tests
________________


🎬 Chapter Introduction – Where Knowledge Meets the Paddock
Welcome to Chapter 3, where things get real.
In the first two chapters, you were introduced to the principles of Nutrition Farming® and the core parameters of soil testing. Now, in this pivotal session, Graeme Sait takes you into the practical reality of soil interpretation—using actual soil test examples to guide decision-making.
This chapter is all about application. You’ll learn how to look at a real test result and not just read it, but understand what it means for your farm and how to act on it. Graeme walks you through:
                                                                        * Base saturation levels and ratios

                                                                        * Macronutrient and micronutrient deficiencies

                                                                        * Antagonisms that block uptake

                                                                        * Strategic foliar corrections

                                                                        * The role of compost and humus in nutrient retention

You’ll explore case studies of problematic soils—high in magnesium, low in potassium, or overloaded with iron—and how those problems manifest in plant symptoms like small fruit, poor flavour, or pest pressure.
More than anything, this chapter reinforces that interpreting a soil test is not just about numbers—it’s about understanding how minerals behave, how they interact, and how you can adjust them to support crop health, soil structure, and farm profitability.

📝 Detailed Summary
🧲 1. Calcium & Magnesium – The Breathers and the Binders
                                                                           * Calcium: Large ion with two charges, promotes soil flocculation (opens the soil)

                                                                           * Magnesium: Small ion with two charges, causes compaction (tightens the soil)

💡 High magnesium soils are hard to work, reduce oxygen flow, and require more nitrogen due to poor microbial activity.
📌 If Mg is too high, it’s antagonistic to nitrogen, potassium, calcium, and overall nutrient mobility.
________________


📊 2. Base Saturation – The Balancing Act
                                                                              * Introduced by Dr. William Albrecht, base saturation describes what % of the soil colloid is occupied by:

                                                                                 * Calcium (Ca)

                                                                                 * Magnesium (Mg)

                                                                                 * Potassium (K)

                                                                                 * Sodium (Na)

                                                                                 * Hydrogen (H)

🎯 Ideal base saturation for medium soils:
                                                                                    * Calcium: 68–70%

                                                                                    * Magnesium: 10–12%

                                                                                    * Potassium: 3–5%

                                                                                    * Sodium: <2%

                                                                                    * Hydrogen: whatever is left (ideally low)

🔁 Calcium + Magnesium should not exceed 80% of the base saturation pie.
📌 This balance affects everything from soil structure to nutrient availability.

📝 Detailed Summary
📐 1. How to Calculate Inputs from PPM
Example: You have 2 ppm of zinc, but need 5 ppm.
                                                                                                                           * That’s a gap of 3 ppm, or 3 kg/acre of elemental zinc

                                                                                                                           * Zinc sulfate (monohydrate) is ~33% zinc, so:

                                                                                                                              * 3 kg elemental = 9 kg zinc sulfate per acre

                                                                                                                              * Multiply by 2.5 → 22.5 kg/ha of zinc sulfate

Same logic applies to copper sulfate (~25% copper), lime (~40% calcium), etc.
💡 Use this simple ppm-to-kilogram method to calculate precise input rates.

⚖️ 2. The Six Most Important Soil Ratios
a) Calcium : Magnesium Ratio
                                                                                                                                 * Controls soil structure and gas exchange

                                                                                                                                 * Calcium flocculates (opens), magnesium compacts (tightens)

                                                                                                                                 * Ideal ratio varies by soil type:

                                                                                                                                    * Light (sandy): 3:1

                                                                                                                                    * Medium: 5–6:1

                                                                                                                                    * Heavy clay: 7:1 or more

📌 Look at base saturation, not ppm, for this ratio.
To fix:
                                                                                                                                       * Add lime to increase Ca and displace Mg

                                                                                                                                       * Use gypsum (CaSO₄) to remove Mg via leaching (MgSO₄)

b) Magnesium : Potassium Ratio
                                                                                                                                          * Controls potassium uptake and phosphate flow

                                                                                                                                          * Ideal: 1:1 in parts per million

High Mg blocks K and phosphate. High K blocks Mg and Ca.
📉 Fix: Foliar spray potassium sulfate + fulvic acid, apply Mg only if deficient
✅ Balanced Mg:K triggers a surge in phosphorus uptake (due to synergy)

🎬 Course Introduction – Unlocking the Hidden Language of Your Soil
Welcome to Soil Testing Mastery—a course that will change the way you see your soil. This course begins by reframing your mindset: you can't manage what you don’t measure. Your soil test is not just a lab report—it’s the most powerful decision-making tool on the farm.
Instead of relying on guesswork or input-driven advice, you’ll learn a root cause approach to farming. This is the path to lowering chemical use, improving crop quality, enhancing profitability, and building resilience in your soils.
Graeme Sait will walk you through each concept with practical examples, case studies, and proven strategies—transforming soil science into a user-friendly tool for everyday farming success.
